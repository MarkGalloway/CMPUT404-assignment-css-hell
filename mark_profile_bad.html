                        <p>My name is Mark Galloway. I'm an Honors Computing Science student at the University of Alberta (est. 2015). I have an interest in automation, parsers, full-stack web development, and competitive C++ programming. When I'm not binging on coffee and code, I like to stay active and fit. My main passions include mountain biking and mountaineering, but I'm also not a stranger to my snowboard during the off season.</p>

                    <div class="col-9">
                        <p>In August I completed a 16 months internship with Pason Systems, where I learned Software Engineering through agile practices. My duties at Pason involved the maintenance and testing of user-facing C#/C++ applications. I participated in the development of an automated testing framework, which used the Ranorex Automation Framework to preform GUI testing.</p>
                        <p> Since September, I have become a commiter in an open source project, Umple. I have contributed in changes to the parser, metamodel, and code generation.</p>
                        <p>Starting in 2015, I became a cofounder in a web service startup, NoLemon. With my partner Tamara Bain, I begun implementing a business-class web service involving video upload and hosting, an extensive vehicle database, and electronic payment. </p>
